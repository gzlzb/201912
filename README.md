Fitness Function for Feature Selection Feature selection methods include genetic algorithm and forward selection. Fitting methods include linear regression and support vector regression. The file name of the training set or correction set is Correct_1.csv, and the file name of the prediction set or test set is Predict_1.csv. The name of the dependent variable is LogBIO. After running the program, the selected features and dependent variables are obtained and saved to the files correct_2.csv and predict_2.csv. These programs are developed with Anaconda 3-2019.03, and early versions may report errors. There are four programs for feature selection: FS_QS.py, FS_q2.py, GA_QS.py and GA_q2.py. After feature selection is performed, Test.py can be executed for performance verification.
